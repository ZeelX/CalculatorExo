# CalculatorExo

Here is a repository for an exercice in python

We use Tkinter and python 3.12 to make a calculator, with only 3 buttons allowed.

Enjoy ! 


## Usage

To use the app, just enter 2 values in the input, select an operator, then press calculate to see result.

All of result are displayed as float, to be sure we never forget a comma.
